            <p>My name is Maul. Im a force-sensitive, Dathomirian Zabrak male. Anointed Darth by the Sith Master Darth Sidious, founder of the syndicate Crimson Dawn
                and co-founder of the Shadow Collective.
                <br><br>
                I am a formiddable warrior, highly trained in the ways of the Force, strong with the dark side and deadly skilled in the art of
                lightsaber combat. Being Sith apprentice of Darth Sidious has earned me the prestigious title of Dark Lord of the Sith.
                
                In later years I've been focusing more on my entrepreneurship and building my own empire, known as the Crimson Dawn.

                <br><br>
                I have a love for nature. As a child, I spent a lot of time in the forests of Dathomir. A strong connection 
                to nature is known to be a by-product of being highly Force-sensitive.
